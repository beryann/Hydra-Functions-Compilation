# Hydra-Functions-Compilation
A  detailed compilation of the functions in Hydra video synth (work in progress)

A compilation made by me of functions in Hydra video synth with the help of AI. Each function is reviewed and explained in detail. Personal corrections have been made in order to be as precise as possible.

After long weeks of work, here is my "hydra-functions-compilation". I first designed it for myself in order to better understand how functions work in detail. I helped myself with AI and the various available documents. The document, available in French and English, is available in doc.x and pdf format in order to improve it if you wish. It is far from perfect! I ask for your indulgence on the content and form. The goal is for the community to take it, improve it and share it again. If you share this document, please cite me!
